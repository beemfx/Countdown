# Countdown

Countdown is a Windows GUI that shows the time to or from a specific date.

Usage: Edit countdown.inf with the date you want to countdown to or from.

countdown.ini should have three lines. Here is an example:

<pre>
Trunky Countdown
2/3/2006
ur
</pre>

The first line is the title that shows up at the top. The second line is the
date. Christmas is a good choice. The third line is the position on the desktop
where it shows up. This can be:

* ur for upper right.
* ul for upper left.
* ll
* lr

Running the program will open a window that shows the selected countdown. Double
click that window to close it.

Quit frankly this program is useless, as I'm sure there are better alternatives.
